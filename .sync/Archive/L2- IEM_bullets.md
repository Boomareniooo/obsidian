# **Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM)**

## **Introduction**

*   **What is a Metabolic Disease?**
    *   Garrod's hypothesis: Enzyme deficiency leads to:
        *   Substrate excess
        *   Product deficiency
        *   Toxic metabolites
*   **Definition:** IEMs are disorders resulting from deficient enzyme activity in a metabolic pathway, leading to substrate accumulation or product deficiency.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   Individually rare, collectively common (greater than 1:1000).
    *   Mostly autosomal recessive inheritance.

## **Classification of IEMs**

1.  **Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism**
    *   Glycogen Storage Diseases
    *   Galactosemia

2.  **Disorders of Amino Acid Metabolism and Transport**
    *   Phenylketonuria
    *   Tyrosinemia
    *   Urea Cycle Disorders

3.  **Disorders of Lipid Metabolism**
    *   Hypercholesterolemia
    *   Hypertriglyceridemia

## **Clinical Findings Suggestive of an IEM**

*   **Family History:**
    *   Positive consanguinity
    *   Neonatal death or multiple abortions
    *   History of a child with neurologic deterioration

## **Diagnosis of IEM**

*   **Laboratory Assessment:**
    *   Newborn screening (NBS) programs for early identification. Early detection, diagnosis, and intervention can prevent death or disability.
    *   **Blood:**
        *   Blood glucose level
        *   Arterial blood gas
        *   Liver function test
        *   Renal function test
        *   Complete blood picture
        *   Extended blood ammonia
        *   Lactate
        *   Metabolic screen
    *   **Urine:**
        *   Color
        *   Odor
        *   pH
        *   Glucose
        *   Ketones
        *   Reducing substances
        *   Amino acids
        *   Organic acids

## **Management of IEM**

*   Treatment differs for each specific disorder.
*   Hydration
*   Nutrition
*   Acid-base management
*   Elimination of toxic metabolites

## **Specific IEM Examples**

### **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**

*   Decreased activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).
*   **Genetics:**
    *   Autosomal recessive. >850 mutations in PAH locus.
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   In Egypt, the national neonatal screening program started in November 2015 with an incidence of 1:7000 live births.
*   **Clinical Manifestations:**
    *   Normal at birth.
    *   Age of onset: 3-4 months after birth.
    *   Fair skin and reduced hair and iris color (impairment of melanin synthesis).
    *   Eczema
    *   Light sensitivity
    *   Hair loss
    *   Increased incidence of pyogenic infection
    *   Mousy odor of breath, skin, and urine
    *   Reduced growth
    *   Microcephaly
    *   Neurological impairments (25% epilepsy, 30% tremor, 5% spasticity of the limbs, 80% EEG abnormalities)
    *   Parkinsonian signs and abnormalities of gait and tics.
    *   Behavioral problems (hyperactivity, stereotypy, aggressiveness, anxiety, and social withdrawal)
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   NBS (3-5 days) detects elevated Phenylalanine.
    *   By tandem mass spectrometry
*   **Prenatal Diagnosis and Family Counseling:**
    *   PAH gene DNA analysis on CVS or amniocentesis.
    *   Investigations of all siblings.

### **Galactosemia**

*   Inherited defect (AR) of galactose metabolism, preventing proper utilization of galactose.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Infants may appear normal at birth.
    *   Untreated infants present with:
        *   Poor growth within the first few weeks of life
        *   Jaundice
        *   Bleeding from coagulopathy
        *   Liver dysfunction and/or hepatomegaly
        *   Cataracts (sometimes as early as the few days of life)
        *   Lethargy
        *   Hypotonia
        *   Sepsis (E. coli)
        *   Seizures
        *   Brain edema
*   **Newborn Screening and Definitive Diagnosis:**
    *   Detects classical galactosemia due to deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT).
    *   Initial test: Galactose level in blood.
    *   Elevated level: Erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity measurement.
*   **Prenatal Diagnosis:**
    *   Assay of GALT activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells.
    *   Genetic testing on CVS or amniotic fluid sample.

### **Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)**

*   Aminoacidopathy due to enzyme defect in catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine).
*   Accumulation leads to encephalopathy and neurodegeneration.
*   **Genetics:**
    *   Autosomal recessive. Deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex.
*   **Clinical Picture:**
    *   Classic MSUD (most common): Symptoms develop in neonates aged 3-7 days.
    *   Symptoms within first week:
        *   Fussiness
        *   Lethargy
        *   Decreased nursing/feeding
        *   Emesis
        *   Poor weight gain
        *   Increasing lethargy
        *   Hypotonia and/or hypertonia
        *   High-pitched cry
        *   Seizures
        *   Characteristic maple syrup smell of the urine
    *   Non-classic MSUD (intermediate and intermittent): Milder symptoms, may not be apparent early.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Plasma amino acids (PAA) testing:** Elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and to detect I-alloisoleucine (derived from |-isoleucine).
    *   **Urine organic acids (UOA):** Abnormal metabolites.
    *   BCKD enzyme activity (lymphocytes, fibroblasts).
    *   **Molecular testing:** Confirmation should be pursued in all patients diagnosed with MSUD to confirm the diagnosis.
*   **Prenatal Diagnosis:**
    *   BCKD enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or chorionic villus cells.
    *   Mutation analysis.
    *   Branched-chain amino acid concentrations in amniotic fluid. Molecular analysis is the most reliable and therefore preferred method.

## **Outcome**

*   Prognosis for survival or normal neurological outcome is guarded for most IEMs, even with therapy.
*   Outcomes likely improve with pre-symptomatic diagnosis (prenatal detection or expanded neonatal screening).
