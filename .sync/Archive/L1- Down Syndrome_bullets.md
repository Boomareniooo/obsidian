# Down Syndrome

**Introduction**

Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by a consistent and specific phenotype and genotype.

*   **Phenotype:** Mental retardation and mongoloid facies.
*   **Genotype:** Presence of three copies of chromosome 21.

## Incidence

Down syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 600 births. The male to female ratio at birth is 1.24:1.0.

## Genotypes of Down Syndrome

There are three main genotypes associated with Down syndrome:

1.  Meiotic Non-Disjunction Trisomy 21 (95%)
2.  Translocation Trisomy (4%)
3.  Mosaic Type (1%)

### 1. Meiotic Non-Disjunction (Maternal Age-Dependent DS)

*   **Characteristics:** All cells show an additional No. 21 chromosome (47, XX, +21). This type results from meiotic non-disjunction.
*   **Prevalence:** Approximately 95% of all Down syndrome cases.
*   **Maternal Age:** About 70% of trisomy 21 cases are born to mothers over 30 years old.
*   **Parental Karyotype:** Karyotyping of both parents is usually normal.
*   **Underlying Mechanism: Nondisjunction** Chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis, resulting in gametes (and zygotes) with an extra chromosome (Trisomy) or missing a chromosome (Monosomy)

    *   **Trisomy:** Individuals with one extra chromosome (three instead of a pair). Have 47 chromosomes in cells.
    *   **Monosomy:** Missing a chromosome (one instead of a pair). Have 45 chromosomes in cells.

### 2. Translocation Trisomy 21

*   **Characteristics:** All cells show a normal number of chromosomes (46); however, an extra chromosome 21 is attached to another one (13, 14, 15, or 21), i.e., 46, XX, +t (14q 21q).
*   **Prevalence:** Approximately 4% of Down syndrome cases.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Sporadic type:** Half of translocated Down syndrome cases arise *de novo* in the affected individual. Both parents are usually normal.
    *   **Inherited type:** The other half inherit the disease from balanced translocation carrier parents, i.e., 45, XX, t (14q 21q).

### 3. Mosaicism (Mitotic Non-Disjunction)

*   **Characteristics:** Individuals have various proportions of trisomy 21 (47, XX, + 21) and normal cells (46, XX).
*   **Prevalence:** Approximately 1% of Down syndrome cases.
*   **Intelligence:** This group may have normal intelligence, depending on the number of trisomic cells present.
*   **Parental Karyotype:** The parents are usually normal.

## Clinical Manifestations

1.  **Early presentations:**
    *   Prematurity
    *   Low birth weight
    *   Prolonged physiological jaundice

2.  **Dysmorphic features:**

    *   **The Head & Neck**
        *   Brachycephalic (occipital flattening)
        *   Microcephaly
        *   Delayed closure of fontanels
        *   The hair is often fine and soft and may be sparse.
        *   Rounded face with a flat profile
        *   Short neck with excessive nuchal skin
    *   **Eyes:**
        *   The palpebral fissures slant upward and outward
        *   Epicanthic folds are often present together with the flat nasal bridge, which may give the appearance of hypertelorism, but the interorbital distance is usually not increased
        *   Small white spots, referred to as Brushfield spots, may be visible on the iris
    *   **Ears:**
        *   They tend to be small and low set, and ear canals may be atretic.
    *   **Mouth cavity:**
        *   High arched palate
        *   In older children, the tongue is often protuberant
        *   Delayed and irregular eruption of the teeth
    *   **Hands:**
        *   Hands are short, brachydactyly (short fingers)
        *   There is often a single transverse palmar crease (simian crease)
        *   Incurved fifth finger (clinodactyly)
        *   A single fifth-finger crease is common
        *   There is often a wide gap between the first and second toes (wide sandal gap)

    *   **CNS manifestations:**
        *   Profound hypotonia (cerebral hypotonia) and laxity of joints are often evident but lessen as the child grows older.
        *   The most significant feature of Down syndrome is varying degrees of mental retardation.
        *   The milestone including speech, locomotion, and social behavior are all decayed.
        *   The intelligent quotient (I.Q.) ranges from 20 to 75, with a mean of 50 (moderate mental retardation)
        *   Patients with mild mosaicism have relatively higher IQ.

## Complications of DS

*   **Congenital heart diseases (CHD):** At least 40% have CHD, of which the most characteristic are endocardial cushion defects, followed by VSD & ASD.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** These include duodenal stenosis or atresia, esophageal atresia, anal atresia, and Hirschsprung disease.
*   **Intercurrent infection:** Frequent respiratory, eye, and skin infections. Serous otitis media may end with hearing loss. Down syndrome has a decreased immune defense mechanism (cellular and humoral).
*   **Hematologic:** There is a 10- to 30-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with the general population.
    *   Polycythemia
    *   Leukemoid reaction that resolves by age 5 months.
*   **Sexual development:** Males may be infertile owing to interstitial fibrosis of the testes and hypoplasia of seminiferous tubules.
*   **Neurological complications:** In about 10-15% of Down syndrome, there is an unstable atlanto-axial joint with subsequent dislocation and neurological complications.
*   **Congenital hypothyroidism** may coexist and requires thyroid replacement therapy (eltroxin).
*   **Ophthalmic complications:** Refractive errors and keratoconus, cataracts

## Investigations

1.  **Cytogenetic studies:**
    *   Although the clinical picture of DS is often straightforward, cytogenetic analysis should always be obtained.
    *   This test provides confirmation of the diagnosis as well as determines the genotypes of DS for accurate genetic counseling.
    *   Chromosomal study can be obtained from any dividing nucleated cell. Because blood is easy to obtain, cytogenetic studies are usually done on lymphocytes. If there is a suspicion of mosaicism, fibroblast cytogenetic studies must be considered.
2.  **Laboratory findings:**
    *   Polycythemia in the first days of life has been noted, as well as a transient congenital leukemoid reaction.
    *   Complete blood pictures and bone marrow examinations are mandatory when leukemia is suspected.
3.  **Imaging studies:**
    *   Echo-Doppler evaluation is mandatory for all cases, even if there are no clinical cardiac abnormalities.
    *   Screening lateral cervical radiograph has been recommended at about age 6 years to diagnose unstable atlanto-axial joint.

## Genetic Counseling

*   **Preconception:**
    *   Inform mothers with advanced maternal age about the risk of trisomy, and recommend prenatal monitoring during pregnancy.
*   **Prenatal**
    *   Pregnant women at risk of having DS (old age, translocated carrier) may benefit from prenatal diagnosis.
    *   Prenatal diagnosis can be achieved by:
        1.  **Screening tests:**
            *   Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein
            *   Unconjugated estriol
            *   Human chorionic gonadotropin
        2.  **Confirmation test:** Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling for chromosomal analysis.
        3.  After a definite prenatal diagnosis, medical abortion may be indicated in some countries.
*   **Postnatal:**
    *   Families with DS must be aware of the nature of the disease and the recurrence risk, which depends upon the cytogenetic analysis of the infant and parents.

## Recurrence Risk

Recurrence risk of Down syndrome due to various cytogenetic patterns:

| Cytogenetic Pattern     | Recurrence Risk                             |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Trisomy 21              | Normal 1-2%                                 |
| Translocation 14/21 (Mother) | 10-15%                                     |
| Translocation (Father) | Slightly increased                             |
| Mosaic (M or F)         | Depends upon the degree of mosaicism           |
