# Pediatric Physical Examination

## General Examination

Gather as much data as possible by observation first.

### Initial Assessment

Consider the following during your initial observation:

*   **Degree of Comfort:** Is the child comfortable?
*   **State of Well-being:** Does the child appear well?
*   **Activity Level:** Is the child appropriately active for their age?
*   **Physical Appearance:** General appearance, including hygiene and dress.
*   **Behavior and Attitude:** Note if the child is happy, sad, irritable, or combative.
*   **Body Habitus:** Overall body build and proportions.
*   **Nutritional Status:** Observe signs of adequate or inadequate nutrition.

### Examination Approach

*   **Position of Child:** Stay at the child's level as much as possible. Do not tower!
*   **Order of Exam:** Proceed from least distressing to most distressing procedures.
*   **Distraction:** Distraction is a valuable tool.
*   **Honesty:** Be honest with the child.
*   **Developmental Stages:** Understand the impact of developmental stages on the child's response.
